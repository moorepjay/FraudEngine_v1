# Fraud Velocity Detection Engine (v1.0)

A simulation-based data engine designed to bridge the gap between **High School Mathematics (NC Math 2)** and **Industrial Data Architecture.**

## 🔍 The Investigation
This project simulates 5,000 "human" transactions and injects a scripted "bot" attack. The goal is to isolate the bot using the fundamental logic of **Set Theory** and **Functional Constraints.**

## 📐 Mathematical Applications
* **Set Theory ($A \cap B$):** Detection is defined by the intersection of the "High Volume" set and the "High Velocity" set.
* **Quadratic Modeling:** Analysis of the "Attacker's Vertex"—the optimization point where script speed meets detection risk.
* **Temporal Domains:** Managing data shifts across real-time and historical coordinate planes.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
1.  **Prepare Environment:**
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  **Generate Evidence:**
    `python src/simulator.py`
    *(Generates 5,000 normal transactions + 60 attack points)*
3.  **Audit Data:**
    `python src/monitor.py`
    *(Identifies the 'Mule' account using set-based filtering)*

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
- [ ] **Step 2:** Visualization of transaction clusters using Matplotlib.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Implementation of Standard Deviation/Z-Score filters for anomaly detection.
